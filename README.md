DESCRIPTION :A project involving a simple calculator in Python typically entails creating a program that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication,division, modulus,prime number check ,pie number and square root 
we will create a simple calculator in IDLE PYTHON APP In this program, we ask the user to choose an operation. Options 1, 2, 3, 4,5,6,7,and 8  are valid. If any other input is given, Invalid Input is displayed and the loop continues until a valid option is selected.
Two numbers are taken and an if...elif...else branching is used to execute a particular section. User-defined functions add(), subtract(), multiply()  ,divide() , prime number (), modulus (),square root (),pie number ()evaluate respective operations and display the output.
